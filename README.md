## Notes:

1. Package instalation: unzip the files to a directory and run the demo scripts.
2. The package comes with pre-trained GMMs for datasets referenced in the paper. Others can be used.
3. This code uses a Graph Cuts library to implement the alpha-expansion algorithm, available at: http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/olga/software.html

This software library implements the Graph Cuts Energy Minimization method described in "Efficient Approximate Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts", Yuri Boykov, Olga Veksler, Ramin Zabih, IEEE transactions on PAMI, vol. 20, no. 12, p. 1222-1239, November 2001.
